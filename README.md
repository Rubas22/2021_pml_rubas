This is my repo for the course ML at CCM UNAM  
All progress is going to be saved here.

For this course, we follow the book: C. Muller, Andreas and Guido, Sarah. "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python". United States of America., Oâ€™Reilly Media, Inc., 1005 Gravenstein Highway North, Sebastopol, CA 95472., October 2016.

In order to run the code you'll need some libraries. You can run:  
`pip install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython scikit-learn pandas`  
`pip install mglearn`  
in your terminal to set up the necessary requirements.

To see the tree.dot documents generated in project/erythemato_squamous_analysis.ipynb it is necessary to do:  
`pip install graphviz`  
`sudo apt-get install graphviz`

All files have been run and tested with Pyhton 3.8.10

Inside python-novice-gapminder-data folder you'll find exercices that correspond to each lecture, as well as a data folder with all necessary data.

Inside homework folder there are two files with my solutions to homework.

In expo folder there is the slices with the topic I presented as part of the course.

As final project, a dataset is analyzed with various classifiers. Such dataset contains records on patients with one out of six skin diseases; for more details pleas read /project/data/dermatology.names. The goal is to compare different models which aim to diagnose the type of Eryhemato-Squamous. Eight of the records were omitted in the .csv file since they lack the "age" field. The original dataset was gotten from "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dermatology" and I included a paper where you can see how this dataset was originally used.
